### ‚ö° **Easy Integration**
```python
from agents import create_legendary_agent, get_training_profile

# Create a legendary agent
sage = create_legendary_agent(
    name="The Legendary Sage",
    profile=get_training_profile("legendary_sage")
)

# Or enhance an existing agent
from agents import Agent, apply_legendary_training

basic_agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are helpful.")
enhanced_agent = apply_legendary_training(
    basic_agent, 
    get_training_profile("balanced_expert")
)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Import the training system**:
   ```python
   from agents import create_legendary_agent, get_training_profile
   ```

2. **Create a legendary agent**:
   ```python
   agent = create_legendary_agent(
       name="Master Agent",
       profile=get_training_profile("legendary_sage")
   )
   ```

3. **Use the agent**:
   ```python
   from agents import Runner
   result = await Runner.run(agent, "Your complex challenge here...")
   ```

## Example Usage

```python
import asyncio
from agents import create_legendary_agent, get_training_profile, Runner

async def main():
    # Create a legendary communication expert
    expert = create_legendary_agent(
        name="Communication Master",
        profile=get_training_profile("communication_expert")
    )
    
    # Ask for help with a complex communication challenge
    result = await Runner.run(
        expert,
        """I need to explain a technical product to three different audiences:
        executives, engineers, and end users. How should I adapt my approach?"""
    )
    
    print(result.final_output)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Custom Training

Create specialized training profiles for specific use cases:

```python
from agents.training import TrainingProfile, TrainingIntensity

custom_profile = TrainingProfile(
    name="Research Specialist",
    description="Expert in academic research and synthesis",
    skill_domains={"problem_solving", "domain_expertise", "communication"},
    intensity=TrainingIntensity.LEGENDARY,
    custom_instructions="Focus on evidence-based analysis and citation..."
)

specialist = create_legendary_agent("Researcher", custom_profile)
```

# Create an agent with comprehensive legendary training
sage = create_legendary_agent(
    name="The Legendary Sage",
    profile=get_training_profile("legendary_sage")
)
```

### Apply Training to Existing Agent
```python
from agents import Agent
from agents.training import apply_legendary_training, get_training_profile

# Enhance an existing agent with legendary training
basic_agent = Agent(name="Assistant", instructions="You are helpful.")
enhanced_agent = apply_legendary_training(
    basic_agent, 
    get_training_profile("balanced_expert")
)
```

### Create Custom Training Profile
```python
from agents.training import TrainingProfile, TrainingIntensity, TrainingFocus

# Define specialized training
custom_profile = TrainingProfile(
    name="Research Specialist",
    description="Expert in academic research and knowledge synthesis",
    skill_domains={"problem_solving", "domain_expertise", "communication"},
    intensity=TrainingIntensity.LEGENDARY,
    focus=TrainingFocus.ANALYTICAL,
    custom_instructions="Specialize in academic research methodology..."
)
```

## Running the Demo

To run the demonstration:

```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Run the demonstration
python -m examples.legendary_training.main
```
